# RoEnhancer - QoL batch script
RoEnhancer - Script for Roblox client to replace "ClientAppSettings" in roblox app and enhance user experience.

▶️ [Script is here](https://github.com/xf1op/RoEnhancer/releases/latest/) ◀️
## How does it work?
- The script downloads custom "clientappsettings.json" file which is moved into **Roblox client** or **Bloxstrap\Modifications** folder that changes various settings inside roblox application.
## What does client settings json do?
- Client settings file customizes user experience by ex. forcing light technology to increase game performance, lowering object and texture quality to utilize graphics card usage. I am trying to maintain this file, make it the most performant and add more stuff BUT **i will never apply exploitable fflags because i do not tolerate exploiters**.
  
## Clickable buttons in script:
### Do you want to continue?
- Yes / No
### Would you like to update or remove settings? (if they used script before)
- Update / Remove
### Wanna change resolution?
- 720p / Default
### Choose Your FPS type.
- VSync / Unlocked

Script does NOT steal roblox cookie, does NOT implement exploits and does NOT contain viruses.
