# RoEnhancer - QoL batch script
RoEnhancer - Script for Roblox client to replace "ClientAppSettings" json and theme inside of the app.

▶️ [Latest Release!!!](https://github.com/xf1op/RoEnhancer/releases/latest/) ◀️
## How does it work?
- The script downloads custom "clientappsettings.json" file which is moved into **Roblox client** or **Bloxstrap\Modifications** folder that changes various settings inside roblox application.
## What does client settings json do?
- Client settings file customizes user experience by ex. forcing light technology to increase game performance, lowering object and texture quality to utilize graphics card usage. I am trying to maintain this file, make it the most performant and add more stuff BUT **i will never apply exploitable fflags because i do not tolerate exploiters**.
