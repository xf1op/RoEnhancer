# RoEnhancer - QoL batch script
RoEnhancer - Script for Roblox client to replace "ClientAppSettings" json and theme inside of the app.
▶️ [Latest Release!!!](https://github.com/xf1op/RoEnhancer/releases/latest/) ◀️
## How does it work?
- The script applies theme and custom "clientappsettings" json file into **Roblox client** or **Bloxstrap modifications folder** resulting in improved performance with or without graphics quality loss.
## What does client settings json do?
- Client settings json customizes user's game by ex. forcing light technology to increase game performance, lowering object and texture quality to utilize graphics card usage by few percents. I am able to change json files and **i will never apply someone's exploitable fflags because i do not tolerate exploiters that make game not playable**.
## Why adding theme?
- For looks. In my opinion it just looks greater than default theme.
